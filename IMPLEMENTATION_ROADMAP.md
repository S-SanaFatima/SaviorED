## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: 3D Performance
**Mitigation**: 
- Optimize models early
- Test on low-end devices
- Implement LOD system

### Risk 2: Model Creation Time
**Mitigation**:
- Use asset store models initially
- Hire 3D artist if needed
- Prioritize essential models

### Risk 3: Complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Start simple (Level 1)
- Iterate and expand
- Test frequently

### Risk 4: Backend Integration
**Mitigation**:
- Design API early
- Test integration early
- Have fallback plans
